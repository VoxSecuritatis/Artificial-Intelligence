Published: 2025-02-21 | Updated: 2025-10-06

## Objective

This repository serves as a resource for exploring Artificial Intelligence (AI) through operational tools, educational materials, and practical implementations. It includes automation scripts, AI-driven applications, and tutorials designed to enhance understanding and application of AI concepts. The goal is to provide a hands-on learning experience while showcasing real-world AI use cases. 

### Skills Learned

- Cloud (AWS) Services – Utilizing cloud-based AI tools and infrastructure to deploy and manage AI applications.
- Foundational models – Implementing foundation models and generative AI capabilities within AWS.
- Machine Learning models and training – Building, training, and deploying machine learning models for AI-driven applications.
- General AI Concepts – Understanding key principles, including neural networks, natural language processing, and automation.
- AI Risk – Assessing and mitigating potential risks in AI deployment, including bias, security, and compliance challenges.
- Prompt Engineering - The process of crafting and optimizing inputs to guide AI models toward accurate, relevant, and effective responses.

### Tools Used

- Cloud - AWS, GCP, streamlit, GitHub Codespaces
- APIs - ChatGPT, Mistral, Grok
- Prompt engineering
